          My unyielding passion for knowledge drives me to explore
          the vast universe and its origins. In college, I delved
          into chemistry, but a costly
        </span>
        <span className="underline m-2">failed experiment</span>
        led me to reconsider. I realized that despite my curiosity
        for matter and its properties, achieving greatness in
        chemical engineering would be challenging if the cost of
        failure remained high.

          At 17, I ambitiously entered a science competition
          with a $200 prize, using $50 of my mom's change for
          the entry fee and supplies. I devised a creative
          "Fruit-Powered Battery" experiment and, due to limited
          funds, I was not able to test the idea. Instead, I
          consulted with my chemistry and physics professor to
          ensure its success. Despite thorough preparation,
          during the presentation, the copper and zinc elements
          inside the lemon touched, causing a short circuit and
          embarrassment. To repay my mom, I had to save around
          40% of my daily allowance for three months.

        And repair the sting of failure, if I dare.

Upon realizing the high costs associated with conducting numerous chemistry experiments, I ventured into exploring other sciences. My first foray into programming was a group project to develop a chat application. The exhilarating experience of iterating through the process of trial, error, and eventual success captivated me. Moreover, the relatively low cost of failure in programming empowered me to fearlessly tackle ambitious tasks, solidifying my passion for programming and the endless possibilities it offers.      `,
